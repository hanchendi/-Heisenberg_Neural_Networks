% A_generate: Generate observation operators, here is four spin system and
% observe the first spin

% B_T1_expect: Generate a matrix called T1, this matrix is used to compute
% the matrix inversion
% Eq. (A6) in the original paper

% C_T2_expect: Generate transform matrix called T2, this matrix is used to
% compute Eq. (A11) in the original paper

% D_T2_by_python: For 5 spin, T2 is too large for matlab, thus this is the
% python code.
